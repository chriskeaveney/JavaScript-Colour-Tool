# JavaScript-Colour-Tool

This piece was carried out as a final year project for the Creative Coding module.
The aim of this project was to devlop a book cover using generative design discussing
Josef Albers work and his exploration with color.

This project was based on the Homage to the Square, a piece by Albers which was designed to help students
and other artists to approach and study color experimentally. This tool also allows the user to do this by
altering the hue saturation & boldness sliders, clicking to randomise colours or move the mouse to alter the border thickness.
