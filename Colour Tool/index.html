  <p>This project was based on the Homage to the Square, a piece by Albers which was designed to
  help students and other artists to approach and study color experimentally. This tool also allows the user
  to do this by altering the hue saturation & boldness sliders, clicking to randomise colours
  or move the mouse to alter the border thickness.</p>
